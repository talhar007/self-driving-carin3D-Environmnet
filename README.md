# Self-Driving Car Simulation using NVIDIA Simulator

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based self-driving car model using the NVIDIA simulator. The simulator communicates with the Python application through socket programming. The model employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict steering angles from input images.

## Features
- Image augmentation techniques for training robust models.
- Preprocessing pipeline for input images.
- NVIDIA's CNN architecture for autonomous driving.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NVIDIA Simulator
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, imgaug
